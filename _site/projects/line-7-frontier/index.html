          <p>Line 7 were looking to build upon their success in the New Zealand marine apparel industry by launching a new adventure brand targeted at only the truly intrepid spirits.</p>

<p>From deep analysis of the market and the Line 7 Frontier product range we identified the core value of the brand being their obsession with quality and the unique benefit of field-testing in the unpredictable New Zealand weather. Not only was this to be a big push into new territory for them in store, but also Frontier was to be their first foray into the challenging United States market.</p>

          <p>Online was to be the largest touch point for the launch campaign and an integral tool in the brands success needing to hit a delicate balance between B2B and B2C. The site needed to sell the brand and the concept with in-depth examinations of technical features and innovation, while also showcasing the products with an e-commerce style experience.</p>

<p>The experience was tailored to take the user on a journey through the brand beginning with the campaign launch video and an introduction to Line 7 Frontier. It then offers a deep dive into the technical innovations present across the range before you explore the products themselves in an e-commerce experience with 360˚ interactive galleries on many of the products.</p>

          <p>Two days were spent in a small photography studio shooting much of the new Line 7 Frontier products in full 360˚ to be used throughout the online experience and printed collateral. Following on from the photoshoot each product’s 24 photos were then individually processed to have consistent finishing and transparent backgrounds. These were then integrated into the website in 360˚ interactive galleries to showcase the products from all angles.</p>
