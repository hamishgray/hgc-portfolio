        <p class="p--lg">The technological innovations of the past 10â€“20 years have made us change how we find information, how we interact, and what we expect of products and services. It's been predicted that newspapers and traditional news media will not survive the next 15 years. I wanted to prove that there is still a place for news media in print and digital formats. </p>
        <p class="p--lg">In todays technology driven age, we all desire total control over all of our devices and media platforms. It's no longer acceptable to sit back and simply accept what we're given. The level of customisation available in every facet of our lives is growing by the day. </p>
        <p class="p--lg">This led me to think of a new approach to news media. Where instead of having the same information repeated across all platforms, instead the user has control over a print magazine, a website, and an app, choosing relevant topics for the platforms and being served content to fit the purpose. The web platform will have up to the minute news and events with some long form pieces for developing stories. The app allows for tiny bitesize pieces and breaking news updates. And finally, the print magazine is broken into topics which are more heavily interest focused. These can be opted in or out of, so you only get what you're interested in. </p>
