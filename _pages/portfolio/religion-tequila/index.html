        <p class="p--lg">I worked with Religion Tequila on retouching their creative brand photography to blend the model shots into church interior photos, and then style them to suit the brand story. The artwork conveys the hero in different lives, showing transformation across time and space. Each artwork is used to represent a level of ageing on the tequila, and so the model’s transformation reflects the ageing process.</p>
        <p class="p--lg">The set of artworks were then used extensively in advertising and branded material, as well as on the creative web experience. The website’s goal was to introduce visitors to the brand, showing the diversity of the products through the creative. The parallax scrolling experience firstly shows the model in a randomly selected time period, revealing the pure version of the photo as you scroll. This is followed by product showcase, and some example uses of the tequila, and finally the brand story at the end.</p>
