      <p>To promote the new Lexus RX, Lexus decided to partner with Secret Escapes to tap into the highly engaged audience of staycation lovers, and present the idea of taking their new Lexus for a roadtrip size test-drive!</p>
      <p>Making this partnership feel seamless and authentic, rather than thinly veiled advertisement was the challenge. We opted to focus on the lifestyle benefits to their target audience of families. Rather than pushing features that the Lexus RX offers, what really matters to people is how it can empower them to have better holidays. With practical interactive guides to family roadtrips, actionable holiday offers, and strategic placement of campaign messaging we developed a powerful and cohesive campaign set to inspire a wave of weekend warriors.</p>
      <p>This multi-faceted campaign ran across email marketing, print guidebooks, display advertising, social media and a dedicated campaign website packed with inspirational content.</p>
