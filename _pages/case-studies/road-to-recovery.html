    content: >
      <p>After suffering a series of powerful earthquakes in 2010 and 2011, Christchurch was left devastated with homes and communities, city infrustructure and communication lines shattered.</p>
      <p>Christchurch Earthquake Recovery Association is a government run organisation that was created to manage the recovery effort in the aftermath of the distaster. I was contacted to create a short film that showed all they were doing to help people, rebuild communities, and bring the city back to life.</p>
      <p>Collaborating with a friend on this project, we decided to use the more tactile, fun approach of paper stop motion to relay the key information, and follow an anonymous character and his journey post earthquake. We chose to use paper as itâ€™s very effective in portraying the story telling feel, giving the film a depth and authenticity that would be lacking in a purely digital animation.</p>
