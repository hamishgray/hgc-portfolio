    content: >
      <p>The brief from Nando’s was to create an advertising campaign that brought an eccentric sense of humour to their customers; and re-enforced their point of difference…their products are flame grilled. The campaign was going to be driven by immersive content web experience and benefit from an 8-week media plan.</p>

      <p>The “Name Your Flame” advertising campaign is rooted in the comedic re-discovery of a TV dating-game. We were inspired by the cheesy and cheeky romantic gameshows of the 1970s and set the show in that era. As the hero of the campaign I designed and built a highly-engaging web experience - presenting contestant back stories, interactive voting and housing all four episodes of content.</p>
