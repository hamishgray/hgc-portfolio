excerpt: Working with Nikon and Secret Escapes the brief was to develop an online marketing campaign promoting Nikon's new camera through the lens of travel and photography. We created a short film series following two professional photographers from around the world who meet in each others home countries to try to capture ‘the perfect shot.’

    title: The brief
    content: >
      <p>The challenge was to introduce Nikon’s new mirrorless Z 7 camera to travel lovers through a partnership campaign with Secret Escapes. The fit between photography and travel is natural and there are obvious selling points to the camera, but we needed something deeper. People don’t shop for camera features, but they shop for an aspiration, a feeling or experience that they can attain only with a certain product.</p>
      <p>We dove deep into the fundamentals of what drives people to travel: to learn, to experience, and to know a place like a true local. To discover a destination and a culture so different to yours, but yet there’s something that resonates so deeply that it feels like home.</p>
      <p>And what better way to discover that love for an incredible destination, than to be guided by someone who calls it home. Follow passionate travellers and photographers from Singapore and Norway as they travel halfway around the world to discover each others homes.</p>

    title: The solution
    content: >
      <p>Mixing the incredible landscapes of Norway and the urban scenes of Singapore, we could show off two photographic disciplines, show the versatility of the camera, and create a beautiful travel piece to inspire the Secret Escapes audience whilst still having Nikon at the forefront of the narrative. Two films were made, one for each location, and both were also filmed on the Nikon Z 7. A supporting microsite showcased the photographs from the trip, with meaningful interpretation of each by our photographers, plus a print photobook that we sent out to members and also gave to Nikon for their Nikon School.</p>
