      <p>Large New Zealand petfood manufacturer, Jimbo’s, came to us with a challenge: launch a new line of frozen dog foods to complement their raw meat product lines. The new identity and packaging design needed to fully integrate the entire brand and product families; whilst bringing a new life to the launch. We needed to elevate the frozen foods rollout, in way that made it appeal to the masses.</p>
      <p>The new Jimbo’s frozen dog foods packaging was a contributing factor to their brand rising more than 20% in the category. The customer feedback from the client has been highly, positive as well - creating a strong footing in the visual space for the product lines.</p>
