      <p>As the leading travel deals website in Europe, Secret Escapes is now household name in the UK. The rapid growth and success of the business came from it’s ability to move fast and expand both in scale and in constant development of the product offering.</p>
      <p>However this rapid growth can also bring challenges around brand consistency - time spent in design exploration and development can be seen as an expensive luxury. As a start-up matures and moves past the initial product discovery and development phase, it quickly reaches a point where brand image and recognition take center-stage.</p>
      <p>I joined the marketing team with a clear goal to unify the design across all channels, both to strengthen Secret Escapes brand recognition and to enable higher quality consistent output across departments.</p>
      <p>This was no small task, and it required deep collaboration with all designers to ensure agreement and consistency. We recognised that there were two paths we could take; either identify successful design patterns from existing designs and create new assets to match, or use this as an opportunity to refresh and modernise the brand identity. We chose to modernise.</p>

      <p>With a focus firmly set on accessibility and UX, we began with the foundations; the brand typography and colours had to be updated with a better awareness of where and how they will be used. Moving to Source Serif Pro and Source Sans Pro meant that we maintain the contrast of font styles that users are familiar with, but now have a font family that are designed to work well together. Legibility of copy was of most importance so colour contrast and type scale were improved and documented.</p>

      <p>With the foundations in place it was onto the grunt work - creating and updating all design assets to fit the new brand guidelines. With limited design resource and a large amount of legacy assets in use, I realised the most efficient way to find out what needs updating is to educate and encourage the people who use them to identify “bad design” based on a set of “best practice” examples. This way there is no energy wasted on redesigning assets that aren’t being used, and we have a smaller, purpose built suite of designs that is easier to maintain.</p>
