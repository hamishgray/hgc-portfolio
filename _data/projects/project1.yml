      <p>As the leading travel deals website in Europe, Secret Escapes is now household name in the UK. The rapid growth and success of the business came from itâ€™s ability to move fast and expand both in scale and in constant development of the product offering.</p>
      <p>However this rapid growth can also bring challenges around brand consistency - time spent in design exploration and development can be seen as an expensive luxury. As a start-up matures and moves past the initial product discovery and development phase, it quickly reaches a point where brand image and recognition take center-stage.</p>
      <p>I joined the marketing team with a clear goal to unify the design across all channels, both to strengthen Secret Escapes brand recognition and to enable higher quality consistent output across departments.</p>
      <p>This was no small task, and it required deep collaboration with all designers to ensure agreement and consistency. We recognised that there were two paths we could take; either identify successful design patterns from existing designs and create new assets to match, or use this as an opportunity to refresh and modernise the brand identity. We chose to modernise.</p>
